      <h2>Ismael Rojas</h2>
      <h2>Nickname: Bebé (for my mom)</h2>
      <p>Hello world! Hello people! I would like to share some things <br>
         about me and my life! So... let's get started! <br>
        My name is Ismael, and my nickname is BEBÉ (for my mom :) ) . I'm twenty-one years old <br>
        and I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina with my parents and my two little siblings. I'm single ;)<br>
        Some of the things that I love to do are: reading, playing<br>
        voleyball, foosball and other things with my little siblings, singing, playing instruments,<br>
        listening music, running, and so many other things!! PS: also watching STAR WARS! :)</p>
      
      <p>The degree I'm pursuing in BYU-I is the Aplied Business Management. Also I'm pursuing a bachelor's <br>
        degree in computer science in my country. If I'm doing this, it's because the help and support of <br>
        my family, a real blessing for me. Some of the things that I love most about the BYU-Idaho is that<br>
        is very accessible and low cost. Most of all, because it's the school of Zion. I'm pursuing the <br>
        degree in Applied Business because it's very practical and it looks very interesting. Although I'm studying <br>
        in the BYU-I to be a Business Manager, I want to dedicate my life to technology, especially the <br>
        high-innovating-futuristic technology (this seems crazy, but... one never knows!). And the web <br>
        design is going to help me to comprenhend how the internet works, how are the web pages are made, <br>
        how to work with them and use them in a job, and make innovations.</p>
      
      <p>For the moment, I'm not married. But I live with my parents, my siblings and my grandma. Well, <br>
        I'm a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints since birth, because my parents <br>
        were already members. One of my favourite quotes is from President Gordon B. Hinckley: "Pray as <br>
        is everything depends on the Lord, and the stand up and work as if everything depends on you". <br>
        One of my favorite scriptures is DyC 101:15-16.</p>
      
      <p>I love coding and I know that it is one of the things of the future in technology!! </p>
